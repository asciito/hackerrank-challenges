## :warning: Disclaimer :warning:

This are my answers to the challenges, so please consider not using to solve yours. Please, don't copy/paste my code, learn from it and make it yours, but don't be a cheater.

The intent of this repository is to make available my answers to anyone who wants to test my abilities and offers me a job, or simply to let other to learn from my mistakes or goals. With that being said, I'm not trying to be a single liner, I try to solve the problems a be clear about the solutions.
